Hey! I am Aditi, a Ph.D. student at the Language Technologies Institute, Carnegie Mellon University. I am advised by [Prof. Jaime Carbonell](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jgc/)  and [Prof. Graham Neubig](http://phontron.com).
I completed my Masters program in Language Technologies at Carnegie Mellon University in August 2019.


My research interests are natural language processing for low-resource and endangered languages. I am particularly interested in multi-lingual transfer learning and how we can effectively leverage linguistic knowledge to achieve this. <br>
You can find my [CV](http://aditi138.github.io/cv) and a list of my [publications](http://aditi138.github.io/publications). 

Previouly, I was working as Software Engineer at Microsoft, India in the Search and Technology Center. 

I completed my undergraduation from Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani, India with a dual degree in Master of Science (Hons.) Biological Sciences and Bachelor of Engineering (Hons.) Computer Science. 

### Personal Interests

I love playing Table Tennis aka Ping Pong in my spare time!
